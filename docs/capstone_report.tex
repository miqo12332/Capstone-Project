\section{Introduction}
\subsection{System Overview}
StepHabit is a secure, AI-assisted productivity and habit-building platform designed
to help users transform long-term goals into consistent daily routines. Built with a
strong emphasis on structure, motivation, and sustainability, the system enables
users to create, manage, and track habits, tasks, and schedules within a unified
environment. A secure registration and authentication process ensures account
integrity, while personalized dashboards allow users to monitor progress, streaks,
and achievements over time.

Once authenticated, users can define habits with daily goals, manage tasks with
durations and deadlines, and organize their time through calendar-based planning
and busy-block scheduling. The platform provides visual feedback through planners,
charts, and progress logs, helping users clearly understand how their daily actions
align with broader objectives. Notifications, reminders, and achievement milestones
reinforce engagement and encourage consistency.

Beyond traditional productivity tools, StepHabit integrates artificial intelligence to
provide personalized coaching and guidance. An AI-driven assistant analyzes user
input and context to generate structured habit plans, refine habit ideas, and offer
actionable suggestions. By maintaining assistant memory tied to individual users,
the system delivers increasingly relevant feedback and supports reflective,
goal-oriented decision making over time.

User data is stored securely and is accessible only to authenticated users, with all
core features scoped to individual accounts to ensure privacy. Social features such
as friendships, messaging, and group challenges are implemented within controlled
boundaries, allowing users to engage in accountability-driven interactions without
compromising personal data. Calendar integrations further enhance the experience
by preventing scheduling conflicts between habits, tasks, and external commitments.

In summary, StepHabit combines secure account management, structured planning,
social accountability, and AI-powered coaching to deliver a comprehensive and
intelligent productivity experience. The platform demonstrates how modern web
technologies and artificial intelligence can be thoughtfully integrated to support
sustainable habit formation and long-term personal growth.

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a secure, AI-assisted
productivity and habit-building platform that enables users to translate long-term
goals into consistent daily actions. The system aims to provide a structured yet
flexible environment in which users can create, manage, and track habits, tasks, and
schedules, while receiving intelligent guidance to improve planning and execution.
Through AI-powered coaching, the platform supports users in refining habit ideas,
breaking goals into actionable steps, and maintaining motivation over time.

In addition, the project seeks to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly interface,
secure account management through authenticated access, and personalized dashboards
that visualize progress, streaks, and achievements. By combining scheduling tools,
progress tracking, and social accountability mechanisms, StepHabit encourages
sustainable behavior change rather than short-term productivity bursts.

Secondary objectives include building a scalable full-stack web application using
modern frameworks, ensuring data security and user privacy, and establishing a
robust architectural foundation that can support future extensions such as mobile
clients, advanced analytics, or enhanced AI-driven personalization.

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Overview of System Components}
The StepHabit platform is designed using a modular system architecture, in which each
major component is responsible for a clearly defined set of responsibilities. This
architectural approach improves clarity, maintainability, and scalability, while
allowing individual components to evolve independently. Together, these components
form a cohesive, secure, and intelligent productivity system that supports habit
formation, task management, and goal-oriented behavior.

The frontend application serves as the primary interaction layer between users and the
system. It provides interfaces for user registration and authentication, habit and task
creation, calendar-based planning, and progress tracking. Through dashboards,
planners, and visual analytics, users can monitor habits, streaks, achievements, and
upcoming tasks. Social features such as messaging, group challenges, and notifications
are also accessible through the frontend, enabling accountability-driven engagement in
a user-friendly and responsive interface.

The backend server implements the core business logic and coordinates communication
between the frontend, the database, and external services. It manages authentication
and authorization, enforces data ownership and privacy rules, and processes all user
actions, including habit updates, task scheduling, progress logging, notifications, and
community interactions. The backend also exposes RESTful APIs that provide a stable
and extensible interface for current and future clients.

The database layer is responsible for persistent data storage and integrity. It stores
user profiles, habits, tasks, schedules, progress records, achievements, notifications,
assistant memory, and social relationships. The relational schema is designed to support
clear ownership boundaries between users and their data, while enabling efficient
queries for analytics, dashboards, and planner views.

An AI-powered coaching component enhances the platform by providing intelligent
guidance and personalization. This service analyzes user-provided habit ideas and
contextual data to generate structured habit plans, refine goal descriptions, and offer
actionable suggestions. Assistant memory is maintained on a per-user basis, allowing
the system to deliver increasingly relevant and consistent coaching over time. AI
outputs are evaluated and stored where appropriate to support reflection and future
interactions.

Together, these components form a robust and extensible system that integrates
structured planning, progress visibility, social accountability, and AI-driven guidance.
StepHabit combines modern web technologies with intelligent feedback mechanisms to
deliver a productivity platform that supports sustainable habit formation and long-term
personal growth.
\subsection{Technology Stack and Frameworks}

\subsection{Data Security Measures}
The StepHabit platform implements multiple layers of security to protect user data,
ensure privacy, and maintain system integrity across authentication, authorization,
and data processing workflows.

Password Hashing.
User passwords are securely hashed using the \texttt{bcrypt} algorithm before storage.
This approach ensures that raw credentials are never persisted in the database and
protects user accounts in the event of a data breach.

JWT-Based Authentication.
Authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are issued upon successful
login and attached to subsequent API requests. Tokens are validated on protected
endpoints to ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive resources.

Two-Step Verification.
StepHabit employs a code-based email verification mechanism during registration and
account recovery workflows. Verification codes are time-limited and must be validated
before account activation or password reset is completed.

Access Control and Authorization.
The system enforces strict ownership-based access control. Users can only view and
modify resources they own, such as habits, tasks, schedules, and progress logs. Public
features are limited to non-sensitive content, while all core functionality requires
authentication. This model ensures separation between authenticated users and
unauthenticated visitors.

Rate Limiting and Throttling.
To protect against brute-force attacks, verification workflows are rate-limited.
Each user is allowed a maximum of three verification code attempts within a one-minute
window. If this threshold is exceeded, the current verification code becomes invalid
and a new code must be issued.

HTTPS and CORS Policies.
All API communication is secured using HTTPS to protect data in transit. Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing (CORS) policies are configured to restrict access to trusted frontend
origins and prevent unauthorized cross-site requests.

Field-Level Validation and Sanitization.
All incoming API payloads undergo strict validation and sanitization at the controller
level. This prevents common injection attacks and ensures that only well-formed data
is processed by the application.

Privacy Controls and Visibility Boundaries.
StepHabit enforces strict visibility rules for user-generated content. Habits, tasks,
progress logs, and AI-generated insights are private by default and accessible only to
their respective owners unless explicitly shared through controlled social features.

Transactional Integrity.
The application ensures atomic data operations by grouping dependent database actions
within transactional boundaries. This guarantees that multi-step operations—such as
creating habits, schedules, progress records, or social relationships—are either fully
completed or fully rolled back in the event of an error, preserving database
consistency.

\section{Application and functionality}

\subsection{User Registration Process}

The user registration workflow in StepHabit is designed to ensure account integrity,
data validity, and protection against unauthorized access. The process is divided
into three structured stages, each incorporating validation rules and security
mechanisms to maintain platform reliability.

\subsubsection*{ Account Information Entry}

The registration process begins with the user providing the following required
information:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/registration_step1_form.png}
\caption{StepHabit registration form for entering account information}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Username
  \item Email address
  \item Password
\end{itemize}

The system enforces the following validation constraints at this stage:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The username must be unique across the platform.
  \item The email address must follow a valid email format (e.g., \texttt{user@example.com}).
  \item Duplicate email registrations are not permitted.
  \item The password must contain a minimum of six characters to ensure basic security.
\end{itemize}

If any validation rule fails, the system returns descriptive error messages and
prevents progression to the next step until valid input is provided.


\subsubsection*{ Goal and Focus Area Selection}

After the initial account credentials are validated, the user proceeds to the
second onboarding step, where StepHabit begins shaping a personalized experience.
This step is designed to capture the user’s motivation and preferred focus areas,
which directly influence habit recommendations, dashboard configuration, and
AI-assisted coaching behavior.

The user is first asked to identify what brought them to the platform. Available
options include building consistency, boosting energy, improving focus and clarity,
or achieving balance and wellbeing. The selected option represents the user’s
primary motivation and is stored as part of the user profile.

Next, the user selects an initial focus area, such as mindfulness, fitness,
productivity, or self-care. This selection determines the category of habits and
templates that will be prioritized during early usage of the platform.

All selections made during this step are persisted in the database and later used
by the scheduling engine and AI coaching services to personalize recommendations.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/onboarding_step2_focus.png}
  \caption{Selection of initial focus area}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Commitment Level and Support Preferences}

In the third onboarding step, StepHabit collects information related to time
commitment, experience level, and preferred support style. This data allows the
system to adapt habit intensity, reminder frequency, and AI feedback tone to the
user’s lifestyle and expectations.

The user specifies how much time they are willing to dedicate daily, choosing
between predefined options such as five minutes, fifteen minutes, thirty minutes,
or a flexible schedule. This value is stored and later used to scale habit goals and
task durations.

The user then indicates their current stage in the habit-building journey, ranging
from beginner to advanced. This selection helps the AI assistant calibrate the
complexity of recommendations and avoid overwhelming new users.

Finally, the user selects a preferred support style, such as gentle nudges,
focused reminders, deep insights, or celebratory feedback. This preference is
persisted in the database and influences notification tone and AI-generated
coaching responses.

An optional motivational input allows the user to express a personal reason for
starting, which is stored as a short textual motivation statement and may be
referenced by the AI assistant in future interactions.


\subsubsection*{Step 3: Verification Code Validation}

Once the initial account details are successfully submitted, StepHabit initiates
a verification process to confirm ownership of the provided email address. A
time-limited verification code is sent to the user via email.

The following security measures are applied:
This mechanism protects against brute-force attacks and unauthorized account
creation attempts.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/registration_step3_profile.png}
\caption{Optional profile initialization for personalized habit coaching}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Step 3: Profile Initialization}

After successful verification, the user account is activated and the user may
optionally complete initial profile preferences. These preferences help tailor
the StepHabit experience and AI-assisted coaching features.

Optional profile data may include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Primary goal and focus area
  \item Daily commitment level
  \item Preferred support and coaching style
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Registration Completion}

Upon completing all required steps, the user is redirected to the main dashboard
and granted full access to the platform’s core functionality, including habit
creation, task planning, scheduling, and AI-assisted coaching.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/dashboard.png}
\caption{Successful registration and initial access to the StepHabit dashboard}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Dashboard (Personal Hub)}

The Dashboard is the primary landing screen after authentication. It provides a
high-level snapshot of the user’s daily progress, shortcuts to core actions, and
AI-assisted guidance. The page is designed to minimize friction by letting users
create habits, schedule time blocks, and log progress directly from the main hub.

Key elements on this screen include: (i) the \textit{Personal Hub} welcome panel
with action buttons (\textit{Add Habit}, \textit{Add Schedule}, \textit{Log Progress},
\textit{AI Summary}), (ii) a \textit{Today’s completion} progress indicator, (iii)
summary KPI cards (check-ins, completion rate, active habits, best streak), and
(iv) contextual widgets such as \textit{Next up today}, \textit{Momentum snapshot},
and a \textit{Daily AI Tip}. Together, these components guide the user toward
consistent daily execution while maintaining visibility into progress.

\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/dashboard_overview.png}
\caption{StepHabit Dashboard (Personal Hub) with progress indicators, quick actions, and AI guidance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Planner Module}
The Planner is the central scheduling component of StepHabit. It enables users to
design structured daily and weekly routines by combining habit-related time blocks,
busy periods, and externally imported calendar events into a single, unified view.
This section plays a critical role in bridging long-term habit goals with concrete
time allocation.
At the top of the Planner, the system presents a high-level status overview,
including the current focus date, overall planning health, and calendar synchronization
status. Users can create new time blocks, synchronize external calendars, or navigate
directly to their saved schedules.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/planner_overview.png}
\caption{Unified Planner overview with planning health indicators and schedule controls}
\end{figure}
The core of the Planner is the routine view, which combines a monthly calendar
overview with a detailed daily timeline. Saved time blocks and imported calendar
events are visually distinguished, allowing users to quickly identify free windows
and scheduling conflicts. Selecting a specific day reveals all associated routines
and busy periods for that date.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/planner_calendar_day.png}
\caption{Calendar overview and daily schedule with saved time blocks}
\end{figure}
Users can add new schedule entries through the \textit{Add Schedule} interface.
Schedules can either be linked to a specific habit or marked as busy events.
Linking a schedule to a habit allows the AI assistant to understand when routines
are expected to occur, enabling more accurate habit suggestions and progress
tracking. Busy events, on the other hand, inform the system about unavailable
time windows and are not treated as completion-based activities.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/planner_add_schedule.png}
\caption{Creating and managing schedule entries and busy time blocks}
\end{figure}
The Planner also supports calendar synchronization through external providers
such as Google Calendar. Users can upload calendar data using \texttt{.ics} files
or connect accounts directly. Imported events are stored separately from habits
and schedules but are displayed alongside them to prevent conflicts and enable
smarter time allocation.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/planner_calendar_sync.png}
\caption{External calendar integration and upcoming event synchronization}
\end{figure}
All planner data, including schedules, busy blocks, and calendar events, is
persisted in the database and associated with the authenticated user. This allows
the AI assistant, notification system, and progress analytics modules to operate
on a shared, consistent view of the user’s time and routines.
\subsection{Tasks Module}

The Tasks module allows users to capture, organize, and prepare actionable tasks
before they are scheduled into the planner. This separation enables users to think
clearly about task scope, duration, and deadlines without immediately committing
to a specific time block.

\subsubsection*{Task Board Overview}

The Task Board provides a centralized list of all user-created tasks. From this
interface, users can view their tasks, create new ones, and track progress at a
high level.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/tasks_empty_board.png}
\caption{Initial task board view when no tasks are present}
\end{figure}
When no tasks exist, the system displays a clear call-to-action prompting the user
to create their first task.
\subsubsection*{Creating a New Task}
Users can add a new task by clicking the \textit{New Task} button, which opens a
modal form. This form collects structured task metadata required for intelligent
scheduling and planning.

  \item Minimum and maximum allowed duration
  \item Optional task splitting for flexible scheduling
  \item Preferred working hours
  \item Optional scheduling constraint (schedule after)
  \item Due date
  \item Visual task color for identification
\end{itemize}
Once submitted, the task is persisted and becomes visible in the task board.
\subsubsection*{Task List and Feedback}
After a task is created, the system provides immediate visual feedback confirming
successful creation. Tasks are displayed in a reorderable list, allowing users to
prioritize items manually.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/task_created_list.png}
\caption{Task board after successful task creation}
\end{figure}
Tasks can be reordered via drag-and-drop, marked as completed or missed, or opened
for further editing.
\subsubsection*{Task Details and Checklists}
Clicking on a task opens a detailed editor where users can enrich the task with
descriptions and actionable checklists. This enables breaking down complex tasks
into smaller, trackable steps.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/task_details_modal.png}
\caption{Task detail view with checklist and progress tracking}
\end{figure}
Each checklist item can be individually marked as complete, with the interface
displaying a real-time progress indicator to reflect overall task completion.
This design supports both lightweight task tracking and deeper task decomposition,
depending on user needs.
\subsection{Habits Module}
The Habits module is the core component of the StepHabit platform. It allows users to
create, manage, track, and analyze daily habits while receiving structured insights and
AI-supported guidance. The interface is designed to remain calm, minimal, and data-driven,
encouraging consistency and long-term behavior change.

\subsection{HabitCoach(AI Assistant) Module}
\subsection{HabitCoach: AI-Powered Personal Assistant}
HabitCoach is an intelligent conversational assistant integrated deeply into the StepHabit
platform. Unlike a traditional chatbot, HabitCoach has full contextual awareness of the
user’s profile, habits, schedules, tasks, calendar events, and historical activity. This
allows it to act as a personalized habit and planning assistant rather than a generic
question–answer system.
HabitCoach continuously follows the user’s conversation context and can safely access all
relevant database tables, including habits, schedules, tasks, progress logs, notifications,
and calendar integrations. This enables it to perform direct actions on behalf of the user
instead of only providing suggestions.
\subsubsection*{Smart Scheduling and Reminders}
HabitCoach can create, modify, and manage schedules through natural language commands.
Users can request recurring events, time blocks, or habit-linked activities without manual
form interaction. For example, a user can ask HabitCoach to schedule a daily class or
recurring routine across a specific date range.
In addition to scheduling, HabitCoach automatically configures reminders based on context.
Reminder behavior is adaptive and priority-aware:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For structured events such as classes or meetings, reminders are scheduled earlier
  (e.g., one hour before the session).
  \item For habits and short routines, reminders may be delivered closer to execution
  time (e.g., five minutes before).
  \item Reminder priority is adjusted based on event type, user preferences, and habit
  importance.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Personalization and Learning}
HabitCoach continuously learns from user behavior, preferences, and interaction patterns.
As users log habits, complete tasks, miss routines, or reschedule activities, the assistant
refines its understanding of the user’s lifestyle and energy patterns.
Over time, this learning process allows HabitCoach to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Suggest optimal scheduling windows based on past consistency.
  \item Recommend habit adjustments when performance drops.
  \item Personalize reminder timing and tone.
  \item Provide increasingly relevant guidance and next-step suggestions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Conversational Control}
HabitCoach supports free-form natural language interaction. Users can communicate with the
assistant as they would with a human coach, asking questions, requesting changes, or
seeking advice. The assistant responds in a supportive, encouraging tone while maintaining
clear confirmation of actions performed.
This conversational layer reduces friction and lowers the cognitive barrier for planning,
making the system accessible even for users who prefer not to interact with complex
interfaces.

communication mechanisms to support features such as notifications, HabitCoach
responses, and dynamic UI updates.
Managing user sessions in real time required handling edge cases such as unexpected
disconnections, reconnections, and multiple active sessions. Ensuring consistent event
delivery and avoiding duplicate or missed updates was particularly challenging when users
navigated across different sections of the application.
\textbf{Lesson learned:} This challenge strengthened my understanding of real-time
client--server synchronization, event lifecycle management, and the importance of
designing efficient and well-structured payloads for scalable communication.
\subsection{Frontend and Backend Integration}
Integrating the frontend and backend layers required maintaining strict consistency across
data models, validation rules, and API contracts. Several issues emerged when frontend
expectations did not fully align with backend responses, particularly during authentication,
form validation, habit creation flows, and error handling.
Ensuring predictable behavior required refining API response formats and improving
validation feedback so that errors could be clearly communicated to the user interface.
\textbf{Lesson learned:} Clearly documented APIs and a shared data contract between the
frontend and backend are essential for reliable integration. Tools such as Swagger were
critical in aligning expectations and accelerating development.
\subsection{AI Integration and User Experience}
Integrating the HabitCoach AI presented both technical and design challenges. The AI
system needed access to user context, habits, schedules, and preferences while maintaining
performance, safety, and responsiveness. Handling AI latency, fallback behavior, and usage
limits required careful coordination between the backend logic and frontend experience.
Additionally, AI-generated suggestions had to remain supportive, relevant, and trustworthy,
which required balancing automation with user control and transparency.
\textbf{Lesson learned:} AI integration extends beyond model outputs. It requires careful
UX design, safety considerations, rate limiting, and graceful degradation to maintain user
trust and system reliability.
\subsection{Scheduling Logic and Smart Notifications}
Designing the scheduling and reminder system was another significant challenge. StepHabit
supports both habit-based and event-based reminders, each requiring different timing,
priority levels, and delivery logic. For example, scheduled classes may trigger reminders
earlier, while habits require minimal but timely nudges.
Preventing notification fatigue while still providing effective guidance required
implementing priority-based logic and respecting user-defined notification preferences.
\textbf{Lesson learned:} Effective reminder systems must balance automation with
personalization. Smart defaults combined with user control significantly improve
engagement and usability.
