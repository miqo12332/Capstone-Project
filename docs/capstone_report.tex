\section{Introduction}
StepHabit is designed to help users build sustainable routines through a blend of
structured scheduling, community accountability, and AI-powered guidance. The
project is implemented as a Node.js and Express backend with a React front end
built on the CoreUI design system. It integrates relational data modeling via
Sequelize, secure authentication flows, and a suite of productivity-oriented
features (habits, tasks, calendars, notifications, achievements, and group
challenges).

This capstone provides the narrative and technical depth typically expected from a
multi-chapter thesis: an overview of motivations, platform architecture,
implementation specifics, data structures, deployment considerations, testing
approaches, and future roadmap. Throughout, the document references concrete code
paths to anchor discussion in the current repository state.

To reach a thesis-scale depth, each chapter includes expanded rationale, design
trade-offs, and operational runbooks. Readers can treat the report as a combined
architecture decision record (ADR) collection, onboarding guide, and roadmap for
future feature work.

\subsection{Problem Statement and Goals}
Individuals struggle to translate aspirational goals into daily action. StepHabit
aims to solve this by combining three pillars:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Clarity}: capture habits, tasks, and schedules in a single source of
        truth.
  \item \textbf{Momentum}: surface progress, achievements, and reminders to keep
        users engaged.
  \item \textbf{Coaching}: leverage AI prompts and habit plan generation to guide
        users toward actionable steps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope of This Report}
The following chapters dissect backend services, data models, REST APIs,
frontend UI flows, and supporting utilities. Each section blends descriptive
text with rationale, patterns, and future-proofing guidance to help maintainers
extend the system with confidence.

\section{System Overview}
\subsection{Technology Stack}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Backend}: Node.js with Express and Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL. Core
        entry point: \texttt{Backend/server.js}.
  \item \textbf{Frontend}: React (Vite) using CoreUI components for rapid admin-style
        layouts and navigation, defined in \texttt{Frontend/src}.
  \item \textbf{AI Services}: LangChain clients configured for Anthropic models to
        support habit plan generation and rewriting.
  \item \textbf{Infrastructure}: Environment-driven configuration via \texttt{dotenv},
        with static uploads served from \texttt{/uploads}.
  \item \textbf{Tooling}: ESLint and Prettier for style consistency, nodemon for local
        hot reloads, and Vite for fast module bundling in the frontend.
  \item \textbf{Documentation}: This LaTeX artifact, inline JSDoc-style comments in
        controllers, and CoreUI component stories to make UI interactions clear.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High-Level Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Habit creation, categorization, daily goals, and progress logging.
  \item Task management with durations, color labels, status transitions, and
        scheduling constraints.
  \item Calendar integration and busy-block tracking to avoid conflicts.
  \item Achievements, group challenges, and community messaging to enhance
        motivation.
  \item Notifications and direct messaging for real-time engagement.
  \item AI habit coaching: plan suggestions and idea rewrites to improve habit
        quality.
  \item Persistent assistant memories to retain per-user context when generating
        future coaching responses.
  \item Calendar ingestion for external events to prevent conflicting habit or task
        plans.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional considerations shape implementation constraints and quality bars:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reliability}: Idempotent cleanup routines ensure a consistent database
        state even after deployments or crashes.
  \item \textbf{Security}: JWT authentication, encrypted password storage, and scoped
        resource ownership checks protect user data.
  \item \textbf{Performance}: Lazy-loaded frontend routes and pagination-friendly API
        endpoints keep perceived latency low on modest hardware.
  \item \textbf{Maintainability}: Centralized model associations and reusable
        middleware reduce duplication as new features land.
  \item \textbf{Extensibility}: AI connectors and calendar integrations are pluggable
        to support future providers.
  \item \textbf{Observability}: Structured logging and consistent error responses make
        incident triage and monitoring simpler.
\end{itemize}

\section{Backend Architecture}
\subsection{Express Application Entry Point}
The \texttt{server.js} file configures middlewares, route mounts, database sync, and
health checks. On startup, the server authenticates the database connection,
performs cleanup on legacy tables, enforces optional column additions, and then
synchronizes models. It mounts API routers for users, habits, progress, schedules,
notifications, group challenges, achievements, friends, analytics, tasks, avatars,
daily challenges, smart scheduling, library content, AI chat, assistant memories,
calendar data, and messaging.

The startup pipeline reflects a pragmatic choice: use \texttt{sequelize.sync} with
\texttt{alter} rather than bespoke migrations. In small teams, this accelerates
delivery but requires guardrails such as preflight integrity checks and backups.
Future iterations could add \texttt{umzug} migration scripts to codify schema
changes for production-grade rollouts.

\subsection{Error Handling Strategy}
A global error handler logs unexpected exceptions and returns a generic HTTP 500
response. Individual controllers validate inputs and return 400 or 404 responses
for user-facing errors (e.g., missing identifiers, invalid statuses).

\subsection{Database Synchronization and Migration Safety}
During startup, the application:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Authenticates the database connection.
  \item Drops legacy tables (e.g., \texttt{user\_settings}) when found.
  \item Cleans orphaned records across assistant memories, calendar artifacts,
        notifications, progress logs, tasks, habits, and friendships.
  \item Adds optional columns (e.g., \texttt{avatar} on users) if absent.
  \item Executes \texttt{sequelize.sync \{ alter: true \}} to align schemas.
\end{enumerate}
This pattern balances resilience with forward compatibility for incremental
schema evolution.

\subsection{Request Lifecycle}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Inbound}: Requests enter through Express, passing JSON body parsing
        and CORS middleware.
  \item \textbf{Authentication}: Protected routes validate JWTs and attach user
        context. Public routes (e.g., registration) skip this step.
  \item \textbf{Validation}: Controllers verify payload shape and accepted enums.
  \item \textbf{Business Logic}: Service functions compute derived values, guard
        against conflicts, and orchestrate ORM operations.
  \item \textbf{Persistence}: Sequelize executes queries, emitting events for logging
        and returning hydrated models.
  \item \textbf{Response}: Payloads are normalized; errors funnel to the global
        handler for consistent structure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Observability}
Operational visibility keeps the platform trustworthy:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Logging}: Structured logs around startup steps, cleanup actions, and
        controller branches aid debugging.
  \item \textbf{Metrics}: While not yet implemented, hooks exist to layer in request
        timing, DB latency, and AI token usage metrics.
  \item \textbf{Tracing}: A future improvement would wrap Sequelize calls with
        distributed trace IDs to follow user actions end-to-end.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Modeling}
Sequelize models define relational structures for user-centric productivity data.
Associations live in \texttt{Backend/models/index.js}, ensuring a single source of
truth for relationships.

\subsection{Core Entities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User}: owns habits, tasks, calendar events, notifications, settings,
        friendships, achievements, assistant memories, and more.
  \item \textbf{Habit}: tied to a user, with schedules and progress logs to capture
        recurring actions.
  \item \textbf{Task}: user-owned with duration metadata, status, scheduling bounds,
        and aesthetic attributes.
  \item \textbf{Schedule} and \textbf{BusySchedule}: define time blocks for habits and
        calendar conflicts.
  \item \textbf{Progress}: links users to habits with dated completion metrics.
  \item \textbf{Achievement} and \textbf{UserAchievement}: milestone tracking via many-
        to-many relationships.
  \item \textbf{Friend}: self-referential pivot for bidirectional user friendships.
  \item \textbf{GroupChallenge} and \textbf{UserGroupChallenge}: collaborative habit
        competitions and participation tracking.
  \item \textbf{Notification}: user-targeted alerts.
  \item \textbf{AssistantMemory}: AI assistant context tied to users.
  \item \textbf{CalendarIntegration} and \textbf{CalendarEvent}: synchronize external
        calendar data with user accounts.
  \item \textbf{ChatMessage} and \textbf{GroupChallengeMessage}: messaging constructs
        for direct and challenge-specific chats.
  \item \textbf{RegistrationVerification}: support for email verification flows.
  \item \textbf{LibraryContent}: curated learning materials that accompany habit
        plans.
  \item \textbf{DailyChallenge}: a rotating mini-habit to increase engagement and
        provide quick wins.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Association Patterns}
Associations emphasize:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear ownership (e.g., \texttt{User.hasMany(Habit)}, \texttt{Task.belongsTo(User)}).
  \item Many-to-many bridges for achievements and group challenges via explicit pivot
        tables.
  \item Self-referential friendships through a \texttt{Friend} join model with requester
        and recipient roles.
  \item Hierarchical calendar structures linking integrations to events and users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entity Attributes}
\begin{longtable}{|p{3cm}|p{11cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Key attributes} \\ \hline
User & id, name, email, password, avatar, timezone, preferences, verification status \\ \hline
Habit & id, user\_id, title, description, category, daily\_goal, schedule metadata, color \\ \hline
Task & id, user\_id, name, status, duration, schedule\_after, due\_date, color, priority \\ \hline
BusySchedule & id, user\_id, start, end, description, source integration \\ \hline
Progress & id, user\_id, habit\_id, date, completion count, notes \\ \hline
Achievement & id, name, description, threshold, icon \\ \hline
Notification & id, user\_id, type, payload, read flag \\ \hline
AssistantMemory & id, user\_id, role, content, metadata, token counts \\ \hline
CalendarEvent & id, user\_id, integration\_id, title, start, end, status \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Data Lifecycle}
Data flows through a predictable lifecycle: creation (via user action or AI
suggestion), validation (schema and business rules), persistence (Sequelize),
consumption (UI queries and notifications), and archival (cleanup scripts). For
long-term compliance, a deletion pipeline should anonymize PII while retaining
aggregate analytics.

\section{API Layer}
\subsection{Habit Controller}
The habit controller handles CRUD operations and AI-assisted idea refinement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Listing}: fetches habits by \texttt{user\_id}, ordered by creation time.
  \item \textbf{Creation}: validates required \texttt{title} and \texttt{user\_id}, normalizes
        numeric targets, and persists metadata such as category and daily goals.
  \item \textbf{AI Suggestions}: invokes LangChain-backed services to generate habit
        plans and rewrite habit ideas for clarity.
  \item \textbf{Update/Delete}: supports partial updates, cascaded removal of progress
        and schedules, and consistent 404 responses when records are absent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task Controller}
Task endpoints focus on flexible creation and status management:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Listing}: returns tasks for a user ordered by creation date.
  \item \textbf{Creation}: enforces \texttt{name} and \texttt{user\_id}, validates status against
        allowed values, normalizes durations, and stores optional scheduling bounds
        like \texttt{schedule\_after} and \texttt{due\_date}.
  \item \textbf{Status Updates}: ensures valid identifiers and status transitions
        before persisting state changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User and Authentication Controllers}
User routes manage registration, login, profile updates, and email verification.
Registration flows create users, issue verification tokens, and optionally seed
starter habits. Login validates credentials, signs JWTs, and returns profile
metadata to hydrate the frontend quickly.

\subsection{Messaging and Community Controllers}
Messaging endpoints store chat messages, associate them with senders and
recipients, and fetch conversation histories in chronological order. Group
challenge routes allow creating challenges, joining or leaving groups, posting
contextual messages, and tracking leaderboard standings.

\subsection{AI Controller}
The generic AI endpoint proxies requests to configured large language models. It
accepts prompts and system instructions, returning generated text. This decouples
front-end experimentation from backend provider changes and centralizes API key
management.

\subsection{API Surface Map}
Table~\ref{tab:api-map} summarizes prominent endpoints and intents.

\begin{longtable}{|p{3.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{6.5cm}|}
\caption{Representative API endpoints}\label{tab:api-map}\\
\hline
\textbf{Path} & \textbf{Method(s)} & \textbf{Purpose} \\ \hline
/users/register & POST & Create user, trigger verification email \\ \hline
/users/login & POST & Authenticate and issue JWT \\ \hline
/habits & GET/POST & List or create habits for a user \\ \hline
/habits/:id & PATCH/DELETE & Update or remove a habit \\ \hline
/habits/ai/plan & POST & Generate structured habit plan \\ \hline
/tasks & GET/POST & List or create tasks \\ \hline
/tasks/:id/status & PATCH & Transition a task status \\ \hline
/notifications & GET & Retrieve unread alerts \\ \hline
/messages & GET/POST & Fetch or send direct messages \\ \hline
/group-challenges & GET/POST & Explore or create challenges \\ \hline
/calendar & GET/POST & Sync external calendar data \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Route Surface}
The Express server mounts routers for users, habits, progress, schedules,
notifications, group challenges, achievements, friends, analytics, tasks,
avatars, daily challenges, smart scheduler, library, AI chat, assistant,
calendar, messaging, and the generic AI endpoint. Each router encapsulates its
own validation and business logic while sharing authentication and error handling
patterns established in \texttt{server.js}.

\section{AI and Coaching}
AI-powered features rely on LangChain integrations targeting Anthropic models.
The habit controller exposes endpoints to generate structured habit plans and
rewrite freeform habit ideas. These services enable:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Behavioral scoping}: breaking ambitious habits into clear steps.
  \item \textbf{Tone and clarity}: rewriting user input into motivating, actionable
        statements.
  \item \textbf{Feedback loops}: embedding AI prompts within the UI (\emph{HabitCoach}) to
        guide users before they commit to new routines.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prompt Design}
Prompts emphasize brevity and behavioral nudges. The system primes the model with
the user's stated goal, constraints (time, tools, energy), and preferred tone.
Outputs are formatted as checklists or bullet points to ease comprehension.

\subsection{Safety and Guardrails}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rate Limits}: configurable caps on requests per minute to prevent
        abuse and control costs.
  \item \textbf{Content Filtering}: client-side checks can reject inappropriate input
        before forwarding to the model.
  \item \textbf{Auditability}: logs of prompts and responses (with PII minimization)
        support debugging and user support escalations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future AI Extensions}
Potential improvements include retrieval-augmented generation using user history
as context, sentiment-aware encouragement, and automatic schedule insertion
based on predicted effort for each habit step.

\section{Frontend Architecture}
\subsection{Framework and Layout}
The front end uses React with Vite for tooling and CoreUI for layout primitives.
Navigation is defined in \texttt{src/\_nav.js}, grouping routes into \emph{Plan \\& track},
\emph{Connect}, and \emph{You} sections. The base layout provides a sidebar, header,
and content area consistent with admin dashboards.

\subsection{Routing and Lazy Loading}
Routes in \texttt{src/routes.js} lazy-load feature bundles for authentication,
dashboards, habits, planner, notifications, tasks, profile, community, and support
pages. This keeps the initial bundle lean while supporting a wide surface of
productivity tools.

\subsection{Key Screens}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dashboard}: centralizes user metrics, reminders, and navigation
        shortcuts.
  \item \textbf{Planner and Schedules}: offer calendar-style overviews and smart
        scheduling options.
  \item \textbf{Tasks and Habits}: dedicated pages for CRUD operations, progress
        visualization, and AI habit coaching.
  \item \textbf{Community}: friends, messaging, group challenges, and leaderboards
        to foster accountability.
  \item \textbf{Profile}: personal settings, avatars, and notification preferences.
  \item \textbf{Support}: contact forms and help center resources.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Management}
Local component state handles transient UI interactions, while API responses are
cached through simple hooks. For larger-scale collaboration features, adopting a
state library (Redux Toolkit or Zustand) would standardize loading states and
optimistic updates.

\subsection{Design System Integration}
CoreUI provides data tables, cards, charts, and navigation primitives. Custom
theme tokens (colors for habit categories, accent colors for achievements) keep
branding consistent. Icons and typography are selected for readability on dense
dashboards.

\subsection{Accessibility Considerations}
Contrast ratios, focus outlines, semantic HTML landmarks, and ARIA labels are
prioritized to make the planner usable with keyboards and screen readers. Motion
is minimized, and user preferences for reduced animations can be honored through
CSS media queries.

\subsection{Responsive Layouts}
Grid-based layouts adapt cards and tables for tablets and phones. Collapsible
sidebars preserve navigation without sacrificing screen space for calendar views.
Touch-friendly hit targets (44px minimum) are recommended for mobile interactions.

\section{Security and Validation}
\subsection{Authentication and Authorization}
JWT-based authentication (via \texttt{jsonwebtoken}) secures protected endpoints.
Password storage leverages \texttt{bcryptjs}. Middleware layers would typically
verify tokens before reaching controller logic (implementation details reside in
route modules beyond this report's excerpt).

\subsection{Input Validation and Error Semantics}
Controllers validate required fields (e.g., \texttt{user\_id}, \texttt{name}) and acceptable status
values. Responses consistently use 400 for malformed requests and 404 for missing
resources, while the global error handler standardizes 500 responses for
unexpected failures.

\subsection{Authorization Model}
Resources are always scoped by \texttt{user\_id}. Multi-tenant boundaries become
critical if organizations are introduced; a future \texttt{organization\_id} would
partition data and permissions. Role-based access control could differentiate
members, admins, and coaches.

\subsection{Secrets Management}
API keys for AI providers and JWT secrets reside in environment variables. In
production, secrets should be injected via a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or
HashiCorp Vault) with rotation policies and audit trails.

\subsection{Data Privacy}
Personally identifiable information (PII) such as names and emails are limited to
essential use cases. Features that log AI prompts should redact PII or hash
identifiers to comply with privacy regulations.

\subsection{Data Integrity}
Startup routines proactively remove orphaned records before syncing schemas,
reducing referential drift. Associations in \texttt{models/index.js} enforce
foreign-key relationships, and cleanup helpers delete dependent records when
parents are removed (e.g., habit deletion cascades to progress and schedules).

\section{Scheduling and Productivity Workflows}
\subsection{Habits vs. Tasks}
Habits capture recurring behaviors with optional daily goals and categories,
whereas tasks represent discrete units of work with durations and due dates.
Both types surface on planners and dashboards, but habits emphasize streaks and
progress logs, while tasks emphasize completion status and time allocation.

\subsection{Smart Scheduling and Busy Blocks}
Busy schedules protect time on the calendar, preventing overbooking. Planner
routes connect to smart scheduling logic (backend service not shown in this
excerpt) to suggest optimal time slots based on availability and task metadata.

\subsection{Progress and Achievements}
Progress entries timestamp habit completions. Achievements and group challenges
translate those completions into motivational milestones, with many-to-many
links enabling users to share progress and compete collaboratively.

\subsection{Calendar Integration Patterns}
External calendars sync through OAuth (future enhancement) or token-based feeds.
Events are normalized into \texttt{CalendarEvent} rows, with fields for start, end,
status, and source. Conflicts are detected by overlapping intervals against
existing busy blocks.

\subsection{Notification Cadence}
Reminders respect user timezones. A typical cadence includes morning summaries,
midday nudges for pending habits, and evening wrap-ups. Push mechanisms could
include email, SMS, or in-app toasts depending on user preferences.

\section{Community and Communication}
\subsection{Friendships and Group Challenges}
Friend relationships are modeled through a self-referential join table, allowing
bidirectional invites and confirmations. Group challenges link users to
collective goals, with messages scoped to challenges for contextual discussion.

\subsection{Notifications and Messaging}
Notifications provide user-specific alerts (e.g., reminders, challenge updates),
while direct messages enable one-to-one communication. The chat model tracks
senders and recipients, preserving conversational history.

\subsection{Moderation}
Community features require guardrails: profanity filters, abuse reporting, and
rate limiting on message posting. Admin tools could allow muting or removing
users who violate community guidelines.

\subsection{Leaderboards}
Leaderboards aggregate progress and challenge completions. To avoid discouraging
new users, percentile-based tiers or personal best tracking can be surfaced
alongside absolute rankings.

\section{Deployment Considerations}
\subsection{Environment Management}
The backend expects environment variables for database connectivity, JWT secrets,
and third-party integrations. The frontend can be configured via Vite's
environment handling for API base URLs and feature toggles.

\subsection{Build and Runtime}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Backend}: run \texttt{npm install} then \texttt{npm run start} (or \texttt{npm run
        dev} with nodemon) in \texttt{Backend/}.
  \item \textbf{Frontend}: run \texttt{npm install} then \texttt{npm run dev} in \texttt{Frontend/},
        accessing the app via the configured host and port.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static Assets and Uploads}
The Express server serves uploaded files from \texttt{/uploads}, enabling avatar and
attachment features without requiring a separate CDN in development.

\subsection{Containerization}
Dockerfiles can encapsulate both backend and frontend. Multi-stage builds shrink
image sizes by separating dependency installation from runtime layers. Compose
files would orchestrate the web app, database, and reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).

\subsection{Continuous Integration/Delivery}
CI pipelines should lint, test, build, and publish artifacts. CD can deploy to a
staging environment for manual QA before promoting to production. Feature flags
allow safe rollouts of experimental AI prompts.

\subsection{Scaling Considerations}
Horizontal scaling of the backend relies on statelessness; session data should be
JWT-based or stored in Redis. The database can scale vertically or via read
replicas. CDN-backed static hosting for the frontend reduces load on origin
servers.

\section{Testing and Quality}
\subsection{Manual and Automated Checks}
While automated test suites are not included in the current repository snapshot,
quality assurance can follow these pillars:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Unit tests for controllers to validate HTTP semantics and error handling.
  \item Integration tests exercising Sequelize models and associations.
  \item End-to-end UI tests covering critical flows: registration, login, habit
        creation, task completion, and AI coaching interactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static Analysis}
Linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier) can be integrated in both frontend and
backend pipelines. Type checking with TypeScript or JSDoc annotations would
further reduce runtime defects.

\subsection{Test Data Management}
Factories or fixtures can provision repeatable datasets for integration tests,
including users with habits, tasks, and friendships. A seeded demo mode would
accelerate manual QA and stakeholder demos.

\subsection{Performance Testing}
Load tests targeting task creation, habit plan generation, and message posting
ensure endpoints remain responsive under concurrent usage. Synthetic monitoring
could periodically exercise critical paths.

\subsection{UX Research}
Qualitative feedback loops---surveys, usability tests, and feature flags for A/B
tests---help validate whether AI prompts and scheduling recommendations actually
improve habit adherence.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Advanced Analytics}: richer habit adherence trends, burn-down charts
        for tasks, and predictive scheduling.
  \item \textbf{Collaboration}: shared planners for teams or families, with role-based
        permissions.
  \item \textbf{Mobile Experience}: React Native client reusing API contracts to reach
        more platforms.
  \item \textbf{Offline Support}: local-first sync for tasks and habits, with conflict
        resolution strategies.
  \item \textbf{Extensible AI}: personalized coaching tuned to user progress and
        contextual data.
  \item \textbf{Data Warehouse}: event pipelines and BI dashboards to study cohort
        retention and feature adoption.
  \item \textbf{Compliance}: GDPR/CCPA tooling for export, deletion, and consent
        tracking.
  \item \textbf{Plugin Ecosystem}: allow third-party extensions (focus timers,
        mindfulness modules) via scoped tokens and manifest declarations.
  \item \textbf{Open API}: document the REST surface with OpenAPI/Swagger for
        partner integrations.
  \item \textbf{Gamification Depth}: seasonal events, badges with rarity tiers, and
        streak insurance options to keep engagement steady.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Management and Delivery}
\subsection{Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{M1 --- Foundations}: establish models, authentication, and CRUD for
        habits/tasks; ship a minimal planner view.
  \item \textbf{M2 --- Engagement}: add achievements, notifications, and group
        challenges with leaderboards.
  \item \textbf{M3 --- AI Coaching}: release habit plan generation, idea rewriting,
        and assistant memories for contextual guidance.
  \item \textbf{M4 --- Integrations}: calendar sync, avatar uploads, and library
        content for education.
  \item \textbf{M5 --- Hardening}: observability, migration tooling, and performance
        optimizations for scale.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Management}
Key risks include AI cost overruns, data breaches, and low user retention. Mitigate
with budget alerts, layered security reviews, and continuous UX research. A risk
register should assign owners and track mitigations.

\subsection{Contribution Guidelines}
Contributors should open issues with reproduction steps, follow coding standards
consistent with ESLint/Prettier defaults, and include unit tests where possible.
Pull requests must describe API changes and database impacts to avoid regressions.

\section{Operations Runbook}
\subsection{Incident Response}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Triage incoming alerts (error spikes, elevated latency) and identify blast
        radius.
  \item Roll back recent deployments if correlated with incidents.
  \item Examine logs for failing routes; reproduce with synthetic requests.
  \item Communicate status updates to stakeholders and users when appropriate.
  \item Post-incident, produce a timeline and remediation tasks to prevent
        recurrence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Backup and Recovery}
Nightly database backups should capture user-generated data and uploads. Recovery
drills ensure restoration procedures are well understood. For AI prompts, a
privacy-safe log store enables replay without leaking sensitive content.

\subsection{Change Management}
Feature flags and canary deployments reduce blast radius. Schema changes should be
backward compatible, staged with additive columns before removing legacy fields.

\section{Ethical Considerations}
StepHabit influences behavior; ethical design is crucial. AI advice should avoid
medical or mental health diagnoses, provide disclaimers, and encourage users to
consult professionals when appropriate. Data minimization and clear consent flows
respect user autonomy. Community guidelines should promote positivity and
inclusivity.

\section{Conclusion}
StepHabit blends goal tracking, scheduling, social accountability, and AI
assistance into a cohesive platform. Its architecture balances modularity (via
Express routers and Sequelize models) with rapid UI development (through CoreUI
components and lazy-loaded routes). The cleanup routines and association
mappings provide a strong foundation for data integrity, while the AI endpoints
introduce differentiated value for habit formation. This report captures the
current blueprint and offers guidance for continued iteration toward a more
capable and supportive productivity companion.
